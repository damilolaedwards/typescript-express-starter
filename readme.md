<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/)
- [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)
